				<p>
					In traditional halftoning screens for printers, the screen is rotated at a 45 degree angle to make the 
					dot pattern look a little bit better and a little less parallel with the page.
				</p>
				<p>
					I tried to do that here and it, uh, well, sort of worked.
				</p>
				<p>
					The dither pattern is rotated at 45 degrees, but I struggled to find a good threshold matrix. 
					I did my best to find one that looked good but really was not able to manage well.
				</p>
				<p>
					The non-rotated matrix actually somehow looks <i>more</i> rotated than the rotated one. I'm not sure if my method was 
					different than the book or not, but the unrotated matrix actually looks pretty good.

					This is the beautiful T-Mobile Park in Seattle, home of the universally beloved Seattle Mariners!
				</p>
				<p>
					What? You couldn't tell? Well as much as I wanted to depict the beauty of my favorite sports team 
					the clustered-dot method is just not good with high-detail images.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm not joking when I say that I tried every single picture I took in the PNW and the only one 
					that really looked good with this effect was the one of two nude cartoon cowboys embracing.

					Anyways, #goms
