				<h2>PATTERN</h2>

				<p>Dispersed-dot dithering uses a set matrix of values instead of a random algorithm. This makes the image 
					much clearer because the tones all have the same “dither pattern”, which makes it easier to discern 
					between the available tones.</p>
				<p>
					Bayer matrices are typically used for dispersed-dot dithering because of their nice, even distribution.
				</p>
				<p>
					A set matrix fixes the number of possible tones, similar to quantization from the last issue. This 
					actually increases the clarity of the image colors versus normal grayscale by creating clear distinctions 
					between them. Image shape detail is still often lost.

				<h2>BRIDGE CITY</h2>

				<p>
					Do you know how many bridges are in Portland aka “Bridge City”?
				</p>
				<p>
					While you guess I'll tell you that this bridge (idk which one it was oops) is a great demonstration 
					of the good parts of dithering.
				</p>
				<p>
					Large, flat, images with slight gradients on them look great under dispersed dithering because the contrast of 
					the dithering patterns actually draws out the contrast of the gradient, which would otherwise be hard to consciously 
					notice. Just look at that sky!
				</p>
				<p>
					It's 12. That doesn't actually seem like a lot, but who am I to question Bridge City?
