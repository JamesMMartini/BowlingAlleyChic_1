				<h2>DOTS?</h2>

				<p>
					Remember the physical halftoning from earlier? That uses circular dots of different sizes instead of 
					dots of different densities to indicate colors.
				</p>
				<p>
					Luckily for us, we can more or less simulate dots of different sizes by just 
					changing the matrix we're using.
				</p>
				<p>
					I replaced the Bayer Matrix with a matrix from the <i>Digital Halftoning</i> book and 
					now the dots cluster together at darker points and spread apart at lighter points.
				</p>
				<p>
					This reduces the detail from the dispersed-dot method so if you want to use it, 
					it's a perfectly viable method, but for digital purposes, there's no real reason to use it 
					outside of its aesthetic function.

                <h2>DRUG STORE COWBOYS</h2>

                <p>
					I was at Hollywood Vintage in Northeast Portland and in their basement spotted these two studs mounted to the wall.
				</p>
				<p>
					I tried grabbing a picture of them but there was some weird glare or glitch on my phone that created 
					these little scratches protecting their modesty.
				</p>
				<p>
					Conveniently this glitch is also a great way to show off the contrast and texture of the clustered-dot 
					dithering.
